# Udacity Blockchain Capstone

At present, property titles are often paper-based, creating opportunities for errors and fraud. Title professionals find defects in 25% of all titles during the transaction process, according to the American Land Title Association.
Any identified defect makes it illegal to transfer a property title to a buyer until it is rectified. This means property owners often incur high legal fees to ensure authenticity and accuracy of their property titles.
Moreover, title fraud poses a risk to homeowners worldwide. US losses associated with title fraud reportedly averaged around $103,000 per case in 2015, compelling many property buyers to purchase title insurance.
These title management issues could potentially be mitigated by using blockchain technology to build immutable digital records of land titles and using blockchain for transparent transactions. This approach could simplify property title management, making it more transparent and helping to reduce the risk of title fraud and the need for additional insurance.
Some companies and governments around the globe have already implemented blockchain technology for the title management process.
Ghanaian blockchain company Bitland has been working on a solution for Ghana, where it is estimated that almost 80% of land is unregistered, according to Forbes. Those that possess unregistered land find it more difficult to prove legal ownership, increasing their exposure to the risk of land seizures or property theft.

Bitland is seeking to create secure digital public records of ownership on its blockchain platform, with the aim of protecting land owners from title fraud. Bitland has expanded to operate in 7 African nations, India, and is also working with Native Americans in the US.
The capstone will build upon the knowledge you have gained in the course in order to build a decentralized housing product as the following:  
- Before mint a token, we need to verify we own the property. 
- We will generate a pre-knowledge proof using zokrates, zk-SNARKs to create a verification system which can prove we have title to the property without revealing that specific information on the property.
- We will be minting our own tokens to represent we title to the properties. 
- Once the token has been verified we will place it on a blockchain market place (OpenSea) for others to purchase.

Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/polarbeargo/Blockchain-Capstone.git
```

Change directory to ```eth-contracts``` folder and install all requisite npm packages (as listed in ```package.json```):

```
cd eth-contracts
npm install
```

Launch Ganache:

```
ganache-cli -m "spirit supply whale amount human item harsh scare congress discover talent hamster"
```

In a separate terminal window, Compile smart contracts:

```
truffle compile
```  
This will create the smart contract artifacts in folder ```build\contracts```.

Migrate smart contracts to the locally running blockchain, ganache-cli:

```
truffle migrate
```

Your terminal should look something like this:

WARNING: Ganache forking only supports EIP-1193-compliant providers. Legacy support for send is currently enabled, but will be removed in a future version _without_ a breaking change. To remove this warning, switch to an EIP-1193 provider. This error is probably caused by an old version of Web3's HttpProvider (or ganache < v7)
